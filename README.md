# AitchBoard - HTML Canvas Drawing App

AitchBoard is a simple drawing application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to draw on a canvas using their mouse. The application also features a clear button to reset the canvas.

## How to Use

1. Open the  [AitchBoard](https://hossain101199.github.io/AitchBoard/) in a web browser.

2. Click and drag your mouse on the canvas to draw.

3. Use the "Clear" button to reset the canvas.

## File Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the structure of the application.

- `style.css`: The CSS file for styling the HTML elements.

- `script.js`: The JavaScript file containing the logic for drawing on the canvas.

## Styling

The application features a button with a clean and responsive design. The button has a subtle shadow effect and a click animation for a better user experience.

## Canvas Drawing Logic

The drawing logic is implemented using the HTML canvas element. The `mousemove`, `mousedown`, and `mouseenter` events are used to track the mouse position and draw lines on the canvas accordingly. The `resize` function ensures that the canvas adapts to the window size.
